# ECP (Easy C Programming)

This repository contains only one important file which is `ecp.h`.

This file holds the whole library, quite the same way `STB` C library works.

You only have to download this file, include it inside your project, and that's it.

You can then access various features such a `dict` type with all it's useful function.
